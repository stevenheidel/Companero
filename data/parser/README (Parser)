PARSER
======

*NOTE*
This is a _work in progress_!

This will eventually be used to help identify noun phrases and prepositions to
further refine the answers. Right now, it has parsed all the articles using
two versions of the Stanford NLP, factored English and PCFG English. Factored
is more accurate but requires much more time, so only a sample of 10 was taken
until I can run it overnight.
