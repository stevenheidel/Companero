KNOWLEDGE STRUCTURES
====================

corpus.txt
----------

The corpus of news articles itself.

*NOTE*
One modification was made to the corpus. Article 75 was missing a year, and it
was added in based on the assumption that the articles were in chronological
order. The year added was "89".

cities_countries.txt
--------------------

A list of all the cities of the world and what country they are in. This is 
especially useful because all the news articles specify the city in which they
took place. It's also useful for helping identify locations within the article
itself and using that to distinguish from English words.

latin_american_countries.txt
----------------------------

A list of Latin American countries. City names are not entirely unique, so when
a conflict happens the cities located in Latin America (as that is the location
for most of the articles) are prioritized.

english_words.txt
-----------------

A list of English words, obtained from /usr/local/dict/words on Ubuntu 11.04. 
This helps to identify potential words which may be places or proper names 
since the entire corpus is completely capitalized.
