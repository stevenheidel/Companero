TESTING
=======

Questions
---------

The questions can be found in test/questions.txt

These questions were chosen because they are representative of a wide variety
of possible scenarios. Also, they were chosen arbitrarily by the partner who
wasn't working on that question type. That way, when a wrong answer was 
returned, the system could be debugged and improved instead of just picking
more questions that we know the system already works on.

Answers
-------

The answers can be found in test/answers.txt

These are in the same order as the questions file so it should be easy to check
whether or not the system is returning the correct values.

Running the Tests
-----------------

Most classes have a main method which is used for testing. Import the project
into Eclipse and then run the classes individually to test the specific parts.

To run the questions through the overall system, run again with -test or to run
for only specific question types use -test when,where
